Cours système intelligent - Henallux

# Introduction

If you want to build an arcade console with simple components as Raspberry and Arduino, you are in the right project. ArcadeCube combines all these components to build an intelligent arcade console. 

At the end of the project, the arcade console will play, for example, Super Mario Bros 3. The sides of the box will have LEDs that will light up according to the intensity of the game's music. The camera, at a certain height, will detect the number of fingers. For example, three raised fingers will put the game on hold.
